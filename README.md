## Inspiration

Inspired by the litter that we all see and produce every day - Trashsnap is an environmental cleanup app powered BY the community FOR the community.

#trashtag challenge
Challenge to post before and after pics of areas that need cleanup. i.e. a before picture of a beach littered with trash, and an after pic of the beach with clean sand now visible. This helps to provide accountability and proof while also encouraging community engagement and support.

## What it does

Community members will be able to take and upload pictures of areas that contain litter. Once an area gets a certain number of posts, it will be flagged as a cleanup spot that other users can see. When a user accepts a cleanup request, it is removed from the list and re-populated as 'needing review.' Other users can confirm that the clean up was done and once confirmed, it will be removed.

## How we built it

idea and inspiration -> fleshed out mvp -> sketch cards and breaking down into small components -> work some regroup -> repeat previous -> have fun

## Challenges we ran into

mapping data and visualizing the data
deployment
git
google map integration with react

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

deployment
geolocation
image hosting
making it through the hackathon

## What we learned

google maps with react is very challenging
trash is serious problem that needs addressing
the people can change the world when we group together to solve problems

## What's next for trashsnap

get some real data
run some data analytics
get the community involved
work with the city to help them isolate high trash areas
