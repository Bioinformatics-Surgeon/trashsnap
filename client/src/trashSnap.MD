## Inspiration
Inspired by the litter that we all see and produce every day - trashsnap is an environmental cleanup app powered BY the community FOR the community.

#trashtag challenge 
Challenge to post before and after pics of areas that need cleanup. i.e. a before picture of a beach littered with trash, and an after pic of the beach with clean sand now visible. This helps to provide accountability and proof while also encouraging community engagement and support. 

## What it does
Community members will be able to take and upload pictures of areas that contain litter. Once an area gets a certain number of posts, it will be flagged as a cleanup spot that other users can see. When a user accepts a cleanup request, it is removed from the list and re-populated as 'needing review.' Other users can confirm that the clean up was done and once confirmed, it will be removed.
